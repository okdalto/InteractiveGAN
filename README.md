This is a simple implementation of a pre-trained network which you can interact by using PyQT interface. You can change the latent value to see how it's going to effect on the output image. By using the output image of the network as an pyOpenGL texture and adding the tessellation and geometry shader technique, I could've acheived cool and reatime visual effect.

Enjoy :)
